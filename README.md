## Interested?- https://interested.herokuapp.com/ (Site) https://github.com/Carl-Lombardi/Interested (Repo)
Our project is a new app which focuses on simplfying dating. Most dating apps nowadays are very complicated with a lot of user inputs. There’s very little mystery about a person, they can basically upload every single detail about themselves and their lives. Interested makes dating simple again. With a clean UI that is fully mobile responsive and easy to navigate, Interested is for people who live life, who don’t have hours to fill out a dating app profile. 

## Why Interested?
INTERESTED is for the type of person who is always on the go. It breaks down a dating profile to the bare minimum and allows INTERESTED users to find a person they may see as a match and in the future, message them. Dating is hard. Let INTERESTED make it easy. No long profile to read. No photos to go through where you aren't sure if the person you are INTERESTED in is the person in the photo. It's dating made easy and simple.  

## Interested uses React, MongoDB, Firebase and MaterialUI.
INTERESTED uses React and MaterialUI for the UI. creating a simple, clean look that's easy on the eyes. MongoDB is the database system used in the creation of the app with Firebase for user authenication. Dating made simple was our motto during creation, and the UI reflects that. 

## Features

## Issues and Solutions
One issue that the group ran into was a lot of these ideas were difficult to put into practice during the development phase and will need to be implimented moving forward. There was a lot of ideas that needed to be put aside for the time being and could be changed moving forward.
